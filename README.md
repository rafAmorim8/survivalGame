Simple JavaScript game developed for the Intro to Web Programming Course at Langara College.

I had to design and develop any application using vanilla JavaScript to get a more practical experience using the language.

If you want to see the application running, plese visit my CodePen profile at: https://codepen.io/RafAmorim/ or go to the project directly at:
